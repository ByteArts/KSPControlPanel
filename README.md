# KSPControlPanel
Remote control program for KSP (Kerbal Space Program), uses the kRPC plugin. Written Delphi using the Firemonkey UI library. This is a working program, but is not polished and some functionality may be incomplete.

Development on this project has been suspended, but the code is here in case anyone might find it useful as an example of using the kRPC plugin to do remote control.
